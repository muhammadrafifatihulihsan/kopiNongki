## 🎨 Design Philosophy

We ditched the boring. We embraced:

- **Modern Minimalism**: Clean whitespace, bold typography (Inter & Playfair Display).
- **Futuristic Warmth**: Combining the cozy tones of coffee (Espresso, Caramel, Gold) with the sleekness of modern UI/UX.
- **Glassmorphism**: Premium frosted glass effects that add depth without clutter.
